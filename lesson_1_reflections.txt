How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Being able to see only the areas that changed made it so that I only
had to look through a few parts of the code instead of all of the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

If changes you make break something, you can easily go back and find out
what happened where and fix it without having to review the entire project.
Also, if the project changes direction, you have older versions that you
can go back to and build from if you are only scrapping newer changes.
