What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the empty .git directory where all of the commit change information
will be stored.  You need to do it so that git knows this is a directory
that it will manage and it allows git to setup the directory it needs.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a cache in between the working directory and the
repository and gives you a visual of what is about to be committed from
the working directoy to the repository.  The value is that you can make multiple
changes and then decide what should be committed  when: you do not have to commit
all of your changes at once.  That way you can create logical commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

You have the option to only add specific files to the staging area for
a commit, so you can choose to only add files that are at a logical stopping
point for a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

If you want to try and revamp the entire codebase you would want to create
a branch.  That way work can proceed on the main project the way it is, but
you are still free to try out whatever you want later.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It really drove home the idea of reachability and also how you can keep
different parts of a project separate while they are under active development.
